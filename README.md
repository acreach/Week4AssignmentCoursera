# About the script
 The purpose of the run_analysis.R file is to get data from [this page ](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones "this page ") and clear it, i.e. to recreate a data set containing all the information we need from the original data set in a way that makes analysis easier. That means we'll try to reorganize data tables, labels and raw data to get a more convenient data set to work with.
 
 To run the script correctly you need to have a folder named 'UCI HAR Dataset' in your working directory that contains the data files you can find [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip "here").
